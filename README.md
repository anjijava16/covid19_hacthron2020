 The live dashboardâ€‹ pulls data from sources like the World Health Organization & JHU to show all confirmed and suspected cases of coronavirus, along with recoveries and deaths.
The Center for Systems Science and Engineering at John Hopkins University is running an online dashboard that tracks the spread of the deadly coronavirus as it makes its way across the globe. The live dashboard pulls data from the World Health Organization (WHO) -- as well as the centers for disease control in the US, China and Europe -- to show all confirmed and suspected cases of coronavirus, along with recovered patients and deaths. The data is visualized through a real-time graphic information system .
